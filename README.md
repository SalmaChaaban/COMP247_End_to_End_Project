1) Purpose
The purpose of this project is to:

Pre-processing  - Retrieve  & prepare the data:
Load and explore the dataset referenced in section 4 in this document using techniques learnt during this course.
Visualize the data and describe it thoroughly, identify correlations..etc.
Clean, transform categorical data and model the dataset using the techniques learnt throughout the course in preparation for building a predictive model.
Model building & fine tuning
Build a supervised predictive model based using a suitable classification algorithm(s) in python , utilizing scikit-learn, pandas, numpyâ€¦etc. To provide predictions as specified in project specification, section 3 of this report.
Validate / score and evaluate the models and choose the best model after carrying out hyper-parameter tuning.
Model deployment
Build an API for the model using Python Flask framework.
Deploy the model on local host.
 Build a simple front end to access the API and pass new feature values to the prediction model for inference.
